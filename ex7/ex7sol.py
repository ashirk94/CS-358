# 2
# (a)
# When A's constructor is uncommented, init A and 2 are printed.
# When C's constructor is also uncommented, init C and 1 are printed.
# When only A's constructor is uncommented, it is called because C's constructor is not defined. Therefore x is changed to 2 and init A is printed. When both are uncommented, C's is called instead because it overrides A's constructor. Then x remains 1 and init C is printed.
# (b)
# Each constructor is only called once, while I expected A to be called twice since B1 and B2 both inherit from A. From searching online, I found that Python solves this problem by determining a Method Resolution Order using the C3 Linearization Algorithm.
# (c)
# The outputs matched what I expected due to the fact that the classes would have the same Method Resolution Order as part b. As x is incremented before it is passed to B1, B2, and A, the fields z, y, and x increment by 1 in that order from the original 1 passed into C's constructor.

# 3.
# (a)
# C++ Example
#
# class Overloading {
# public:
#     int multiplyNums(int x, int y) {
#         return x * y;
#     }
#     double multiplyNums(double x, double y) {
#         return x * y;
#     }
# };
# (b)
class Parent:
    def whoami(self):
        return "Parent class"

class Child(Parent):
    def whoami(self):
        return "Child class"
# (c)
# Part b I was able to write in Python because Python supports overriding natively as was shown in problem 2a. Part a on the other hand I could not because Python does not support true method overloading. The C++ overloading example I wrote would not make sense in Python because Python is dynamically typed.
