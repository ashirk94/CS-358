Assignment 2 Report
Alan Shirk

Both programs work correctly with all test cases conducted, including sum.st and skip.st. The expr2 program was challenging to figure out how to implement operator chaining with Python semantics. At first for expr.py I created a function for each operator but then I was able to get the list of operators to work with a simplified relex production rule. That way I was able to pass the operator to the relop method in the interpreter which made things easier and cleaner. For stmt.py, I at first struggled to parse the brackets so I changed the grammar start rule so that brackets could be parsed from the start. In the output, the n variable is not lined up next to assign, and the relop operators are displayed between terminals, but the output does appear to be valid for each case that I tested. In this assignment I learned a lot about how to implement the statement and expression languages, and chaining operators. It was interesting to see how 'if' statements and block statements could be implemented in a simple programming language.
