Exercise 5: Parameter Passing and More Environments

1.
y = 1
y = 1 + 1 = 2
x = 1 + 2 = 3
y = 2
Call by value: (3, 2), 2

y = 1
y = 1 + 1 = 2
x = 2 + 2 = 4
y = 4
Call by reference: (4, 4), 4

y = 1
y = 1 + 1 = 2
x = 1 + 2 = 3
y = 3
Call by value result: (3, 2), 3

y = 1
y = y + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
x = y + y = 2 + 2 = 4
y = 4
Call by name: (4, 4), 4
